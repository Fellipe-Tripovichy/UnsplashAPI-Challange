Build a mobile app that displays a list of photos from the Unsplash API, allows the user to search for photos by keyword, and enables them to save their favorite photos to a "favorites" list.

Requirements:

-> The app should display a list of photos from the Unsplash API, including the photo's title, author, and thumbnail image. The list should be scrollable and support pagination, so the user can view more than the default 10 photos.

-> The app should include a search bar that allows the user to search for photos by keyword. When the user types a keyword into the search bar and hits "Enter", the app should display a list of photos matching that keyword.

-> The app should allow the user to save their favorite photos to a "favorites" list. Each photo in the list should have a "Add to favorites" button that the user can tap to add the photo to their favorites list.

-> The app should include a separate "favorites" screen that displays a list of the user's favorite photos. Each photo in the favorites list should have a "Remove from favorites" button that the user can tap to remove the photo from their favorites list.

-> The app should have a clean and modern design, with a consistent color scheme and typography throughout. It should be responsive and work well on both iOS and Android devices.

Optional:

-> Add a "share" button that allows the user to share a photo with their friends via social media, text message, or email.

-> Add a "download" button that allows the user to download a photo to their device.

-> Add a feature that allows the user to filter the photo list by color or orientation (portrait or landscape).

-> Implement a feature that allows the user to swipe left or right to switch between photos in the photo list or favorites list.

-> Add a feature that allows the user to sort the photo list by popularity, date, or relevance.

Good luck, have fun!
